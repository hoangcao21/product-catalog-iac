# Pre-requisites
First, you need to install AWS CDK and follow AWS instructions to set up your AWS credentials.

Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html

# Folder structure
```
└── 📁bin
    └── product-catalog-iac.ts // Entry point of your CDK
└── 📁lib
    └── backend-stack.ts // Stack that consists of your backend-related AWS resources
    └── frontend-stack.ts // Stack that consists of your frontend-related AWS resources
```

# Provision your AWS resources by using AWS CDK
You can have 2 options:
- Deploy all stacks
- Deploy stack one by one

## Deploy all stacks
To deploy all stacks to AWS, you need to execute this command `cdk deploy --all` and follow the prompt generated by AWS CDK CLI.

After successful deployment, console should output the values of `CfnOutput` constructs.

## Deploy stack one by one
To deploy a specific stack to AWS, you need to execute this command `cdk deploy <StackConstructId>` and follow the prompt generated by AWS CDK CLI. For example,
```
cdk deploy ProductCatalogBackendStack
```

After successful deployment, console should output the values of `CfnOutput` constructs.
